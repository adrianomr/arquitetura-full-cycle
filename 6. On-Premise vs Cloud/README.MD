# On-Premise vs Cloud

## On-Premise

### Disvantages

* Softwares installed locally or in company's data centers
* High initial cost
* Hardware has depreciation
* Hardware demands maintanance
* Needs qualified professionals about hardware, networks, software, virtualization, etc.
* Dificulty to scalle
* High availability is complex (needs more datacenters, in diferent zones, at same time)

### Advantages

* High control on software, hardware, security protocols, etc.
* Highly customizable
* Direct access by company employees
* Hardware usually is cheaper and more powerful than default cloud machines
* Data Control
* Legacy systems integration
* Compliance and regulation (Storage, PCI DSS, HIPPA(Health Care))
* Previsible costs
* Without Lock In
* If well diminsioned, intial cost is paid during the years
* On long term, and if well planned, it is cheaper than Cloud Solutions

## Cloud Computing

### Disvantages

* High cost during time to determinated services
* High cost for data transfering
* Cost estimation is really difficult
* Strong lock-in
* Additional risks with security*
* Limited controll for upgrading hardware
* Compliance*
* Integration with legacy systems can be complex

## Advantages

* Low initial cost
* Scalability is simple
* Accesibility (services available)
* High disponibility is simple (Regions and AZs)
* Costs with professinals espcialized into datacenter, network, hardware, etc
* Hardware demands maitanance
* Automatization for backups
* Mananged Services
* Fast recover during disasters

## Hibrid Model

* Can be a transition model
* Alternative model to have more control over data and specific services, without losing cloud advantages
* Costs controll over sazional periods
* Software integrations can be more complex
* Latency can be a challange
* Especiallized Professionals into different areas
* Can also be a multicloud solution
